== Primes - multi-language prime number algorithm optimization

This project is motivated by:

1. My desire to have a small, self contained project to learn [GIT][] version control and [Markdown][] documentation methodology.
2. To use the project to practice pushing changes to my local [GITLAB][] server and to my accounts at [GitHub][] and [GitLab][].
3. The Daniel Clifford presentation [Breaking the JavaScript Speed Limit with V8][] from 2012 Google IO.
4. My interest in [prime numbers][].
5. My interest in [programming languages][].
6. My interest in [code optimization][].

In `Breaking the JavaScript Speed Limit with V8`, Daniel Clifford shows how to optimize a prime number generator written in [Javascript][]
using knowledge of the underlying V8 implementation written in [C++][]. He shows examples of the generator written in javascript and C++,
then compares the execution speed of the javascript version running under V8 to the C++ version.

The two versions of the algorithm are presented on [slide 15][] of Cliffords presentation.
